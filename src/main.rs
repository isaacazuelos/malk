//! Experiments with bare metal rust programming on an Pro Micro.

// This feature lets us use inline assembly, used to avoid optimizing away our
// busy loop.

// We don't have an operating system or allocator, so `std` is not an option.

// We need to extern our main differently so that the linker can find it. See
