# Malk

![Now with vitamin R](http://static1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130325185942/simpsons/images/3/3c/Malk.jpg)

I bought a [2% Milk][milk] macro board as a way to play with embedded rust.

To be clear, I have no idea what I'm doing. If this bricks anything, it's your fault for trusting randos on github.

## What it does

Right now, it blinks RX LED. When the top button on the Milk is pressed the light stays on. When the bottom button is pressed, it stays off. If both are pressed, it stays off.

This was just to make sure I could correctly interpret the manual and read or write to the correct registers, and could use the GPIO pins.

## How to set it up

If you use [nix][] you can use the included `shell.nix` with `nix-shell` and hack away. Otherwise you'll need an AVR GCC (for linking), a libc, and a flasher like avr-dude.

[nix]: https://nixos.org/

You can build the binary with the following `cargo` incantation. This assumes you're on nightly. You may need to use `cargo +nighty build` if you have stable installed too.

```sh
cargo build -Z build-std=core --target avr-atmega32u4.json --release
```

If it works, you can find the binary at `./target/avr-atmega32u4/release/malk.elf`

You can then flash it to your Pro Micro. I have a regular knock off, so the `avrdude-flash.sh` script helps automate finding the device.

In my experience, flashing failed more than it succeeded at first. Here are some things to try if you're having issues:

1. Some issues may be made worse by USB 3 ports according to folk wisdom.
2. Make sure your user is in the `dialout` group.
3. Reset the Pro Micro (by bridging reset to ground) twice in quick succession
   to force it into the bootloader for 8 seconds.

Huge thanks to Philipp Opperman and his [blog_os][] post on stand-alone binaries.

The [avr-rust/blink][blink] repo has a lot of good info on getting things set up, especially the linked book, and was largely where the target `.json` file comes from. It's a little dated, in that AVR support has landed in nightly.

Also reading QMK's `shell.nix` helped me find some of the nixpkgs names of packages.

There's a great diagram of the board's pinout (crucially with what port the pins belong two) available on the [QQTrading product page][pinout].

This [pull up resistor tutorial][bald] was also helpful. If you're trying this I recommend building with it off so you can see what floating does too.

And of course reading the [manual].

The specific `avrdude-flash.sh` script is from [Nooges' gist][gist] and I have no idea what license it would fall under.
